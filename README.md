This project is born out of my love for movies and in particular online videos. I decide to conclude my ALX journey with sharing my love for movies with the whole world for free. It is intended to provide a means of entertainment to viewers for free without a single charge. I believe in freedom:

THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PROJECT:
My Portfolio Project
1. AWS Account Setup:
I will Create an AWS account on the AWS website.
2. I will Use AWS Services for Video Streaming:
a. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Store my video files in Amazon S3. Here I will Create buckets to organize the content of my media.
I will Enable static website hosting on the bucket where all the videos will be stored.
b. I will use the Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network):
Then Iâ€™ll Set up CloudFront to deliver video content globally with low latency. I will then Create a distribution for your S3 bucket.
c. I will employ the use of the AWS Elemental Media Convert or Elastic Transcoder:
Use MediaConvert or Elastic Transcoder to encode my videos into different formats suitable for streaming.
d. I will use the AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB (Optional for User Management):
Then Implement Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to handle user authentication, access control, and user data storage.
e. I will also use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage (Optional for Live Streaming):
If you plan to offer live streaming, consider using MediaPackage for secure and reliable live video delivery.
3. I will move on to Create a Website/Application:
Develop a website or application using a framework or programming language of my choice.
I will Use AWS SDKs or APIs to interact with AWS services from the application.
4. I will also Integrate a Video Player:
Here I will Integrate a video player in the website/application to stream the videos hosted on Amazon S3 via CloudFront URLs.
5. Security and Access Control:
I will Implement security measures like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), signed URLs, and encryption to protect the media content.
6. Testing and Monitoring:
I will Test the website thoroughly for video playback, user experience, and performance.
I will Set up monitoring and logging to track usage, errors, and performance metrics using AWS CloudWatch.
7. Time to Launch and Scale:
Once everything is set up and tested, I will launch the video streaming website.
I will Monitor usage and performance to scale resources if needed.
