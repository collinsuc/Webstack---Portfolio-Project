This project is born out of my love for movies and in particular online videos. I decide to conclude my ALX journey with sharing my love for movies with the whole world for free. It is intended to provide a means of entertainment to viewers for free without a single charge. I believe in freedom:

THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PROJECT:
My Portfolio Project
1. AWS Account Setup:
I will Create an AWS account on the AWS website.
2. I will Use AWS Services for Video Streaming:
a. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Store my video files in Amazon S3. Here I will Create buckets to organize the content of my media.
I will Enable static website hosting on the bucket where all the videos will be stored.
b. I will use the Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network):
Then I’ll Set up CloudFront to deliver video content globally with low latency. I will then Create a distribution for your S3 bucket.
c. I will employ the use of the AWS Elemental Media Convert or Elastic Transcoder:
Use MediaConvert or Elastic Transcoder to encode my videos into different formats suitable for streaming.
d. I will use the AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB (Optional for User Management):
Then Implement Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to handle user authentication, access control, and user data storage.
e. I will also use the AWS Elemental MediaPackage (Optional for Live Streaming):
If you plan to offer live streaming, consider using MediaPackage for secure and reliable live video delivery.
3. I will move on to Create a Website/Application:
Develop a website or application using a framework or programming language of my choice.
I will Use AWS SDKs or APIs to interact with AWS services from the application.
4. I will also Integrate a Video Player:
Here I will Integrate a video player in the website/application to stream the videos hosted on Amazon S3 via CloudFront URLs.
5. Security and Access Control:
I will Implement security measures like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), signed URLs, and encryption to protect the media content.
6. Testing and Monitoring:
I will Test the website thoroughly for video playback, user experience, and performance.
I will Set up monitoring and logging to track usage, errors, and performance metrics using AWS CloudWatch.
7. Time to Launch and Scale:
Once everything is set up and tested, I will launch the video streaming website.
I will Monitor usage and performance to scale resources if needed.

Name of the project: Freedom views
List of team members: Collins Godswill Ahuchaogu
Description of the project: This is intended to be a free live streaming website; a full description is in the next slide.
Learning objectives: To master the art of anchoring a live streaming site on AWS
THE FINAL SUBMISSION:
My Methodology on creating a live streaming website
•	The Project Idea: The idea behind this project, ultimately is to build/create a website that allows viewers to watch movies online for free, gain traffic, and later place product pricing on some on-demand views. Here, prospective customers will enjoy free videos online, then when they demand for current movies; we place a $3-5 monthly price on it.
•	The project aims & Mission: The aim and mission of this project is essentially to entertain the public all for free, then for special choice of movies, it will go for a token. Essentially, this is aimed at providing cheaper means of entertainment to the public.
•	Choosing a website Builder: The choice of a web builder is a critical and crucial one, as on an initial plan, it was to be done on an AWS server, where I was to register an AWS account and use Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storage of the files. Then I’ll create a bucket for storage of the videos, then use the Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network) to deliver the video globally, hence, create a distribution network. Next is to use the Use MediaConvert or Elastic Transcoder to encode my videos into different formats suitable for streaming, use the AWS lambda, API gateway and DynamoDB to manage users online  etc. But considering the cost and timeframe, I will save this project setup in my git hub account, make proper financial preparations and plans and lunch it later on. For now I use maestro.tv as a lunch platform, where I can register my domain name, configure my site to what I want, and publish my videos all for free, though without the live-stream.
•	Configuring a video hosting site: As stated earlier, the video hosting site is configured on the maestro.tv site based on the huge financial cost involved in using the AWS for now.
•	Webpage Strategy & subdomain: The subdomain is hosted on the maestro.tv site and it give the ability to use APIs like youtube and also I can create a bucket where my local videos can be uploaded from my local machine to the bucket for viewing.
•	Content building and uploads: Based on the limited service given for the free version, I can create a movie channel, build content both from other plugins/links and from my local machine and all the videos will be available for viewers anytime they login to my channel. They will just have to register for free to my channel, then watch movies.
•	Publishing and deployment: After the content was built, it was published from the newly created channel that I created and it currently available on https://maestro.tv/freedomviews.
•	Functionality and testing: The site has been tested and it is functioning, running well at the moment, though plans are in progress to include the streaming option also.
•	Finances, Pricing and monetization: As the customer base grows, I intend to generate income by means of adverts or providing specialized viewing option as stated erlier.
•	Further Developments: In the future, I will move on to create plugins on social media sites then later lunch freedom views in AWS as planned.
•	Thanks for YOUR your time.
